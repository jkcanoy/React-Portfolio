      <p>
        Hi, my name is Kyle and I am currently a CNA for the Burn/Pediatric ICU
        at Harborview Medical Center, and was in the process of starting a
        career in medicine with a hope of becoming a physician.
      </p>
      <p>
        However I am putting that on pause and exploring a career in web
        development. I am currently in the UW Coding Bootcamp in the hopes of
        becoming a web developer. I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS, Node,
        Express, MySQL, MongoDB, and React
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time I like to play video games, watch movies, occasionally
        read books when the planets align and the moon is full, and do things
        outdoors like hiking and camping.
      </p>
    </div>
